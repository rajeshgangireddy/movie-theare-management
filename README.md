# Movie Theatre Management Project in C++
This repository contains a Theatre Management System built using C++. 
The project was designed to manage theatre operations, such as booking and managing shows, without relying on external graphics libraries like graphics.h.

**Note: I developed this project during my 12th grade, so while it served its purpose at the time, it may not meet the standards of more advanced or modern C++ projects today.**

## Features
Welcome Screen: A user-friendly interface to start the application.
### Login System:
User Mode: Users can view available shows, book tickets, and manage their bookings.
Admin Mode: Admins have the ability to add, edit, or remove show details.
### File Handling: All data is stored in text files, which are created and managed by the application itself.

## Technology Stack
Language: C++ (compatible with older Turbo C++ and modern compilers)
Data Storage: Text files (no external database required)

## Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler.
Run the executable to launch the application.

## Compatibility
Originally developed for Turbo C++ (Blue Screen IDE).
Haven't tested this after 2013.
